## Instructions
1. Fork and clone this repo - [week2.day1.uglyHTML](https://github.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week2.day1.uglyHTML)
2. The HTML has already been written for you! Do NOT alter the HTML file in any way.
3. Your task is to style the website based on a client’s wireframe by adding the appropriate CSS.
    - ![Wireframe #1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week2.day1.uglyHTML/master/watch_wireframe1.png)
    - ![Wireframe #2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllStarCodeOrg/week2.day1.uglyHTML/master/watch_wireframe2.png)
    - *NOTE: being able to follow a wireframe’s specifications is an important skill for any developer*
4. Recommendations:
    - Use CSS to target element tags (h2, article, img, footer, etc.)
    - Use CSS to target elements by classes (.watch_container, .text)
        - *Note: elements have already been given relevant classes and id’s*
    - **Tip:** Having an image alongside text can be tricky. Try giving the img a “float:left” property, which makes EVERYTHING after the element float to the left of the previous element.
        - You don’t want every HTML element afterwards to “float” except the text immediately after the img. So, you’ll want to clear this effect at the beginning of every “.watch_container” with “clear:left” (“clear:both” also works!)
